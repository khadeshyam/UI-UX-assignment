**Project Title:** React Event Visualizer

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a ReactJS front-end application that receives event data from a REST API server and displays it in a visually appealing and informative manner, adhering to a specified wireframe design.

**Key Features:**

- Data retrieval and processing: Fetches JSON event data from the backend server.
- Dynamic display: Transforms received data into visually distinct boxes based on message category, type, and content.
- Interactive element: Allows users to click on a specific box, triggering a color and text change, and sending an event back to the server.

**User Interface:**

- **Logo:** Displays a static logo at the top (configurable as needed).
- **Event Boxes:**
    - Box 1: Shows the event ID in white text.
    - Box 2: Displays the message type (A, B, C, or D) in its designated color.
    - Box 3: Initially yellow with the text "U", changes to green with "A" on click.
    - Text Boxes: Present Text 1 and Text 2 as received from the server.
- **Responsiveness:** Adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

**Technology Stack:**

- ReactJS: Front-end framework for building the dynamic user interface.
- REST API: Backend server providing event data in JSON format.
- Optional: Additional libraries or tools as needed for styling, data manipulation, or communication.

**Setup and Installation:**

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the project files manually.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install required dependencies.
5. (Optional) Configure the backend API URL and any other environment variables as needed.

**Running the Application:**

1. Start the development server:
    - `npm start` (or `yarn start`)
2. Access the application in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000/.

**Simulating Events:**

- Use a tool like Postman to send sample JSON event data to the backend server, simulating real-time communication.
- The front-end should dynamically update to reflect the received events.

**Additional Notes:**

- This README serves as a starting point and may need adjustments based on project specifics.
- Further instructions and implementation details can be added as the project progresses.
- Provide a clear understanding of any assumptions or dependencies.
- Include instructions for any specific tooling or configuration required.
